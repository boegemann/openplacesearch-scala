General README
==============

= Data Sources =
* iso639Languages: http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/iso-languagecodes.txt
* countries: http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/countryInfo.txt
* ADM1:
** http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/admin1Codes.txt (not used anymore)
** http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/admin1CodesASCII.txt
* ADM2:
** http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/admin2Codes.txt

= Features =
* Access ISO-639 Languages
* Access Countries, with their currency, and more
* Access First and Second order administrative divisions
* Full-text search of places (cities)
* GIS "near" search of places (cities)

= Limitations =
* We do not import ADM3 and ADM4
* no work around the 10-result limitation of stock gisgraphy (needs a patched gisgraphy to get more results)
* childAdministrativeDivisions() returns all children. No way to add additional filters. 
* no lazy alternate names fetcher for geolocresults (so, we have no alternate names for geoloc results)
* uses FULL => slower than required. LONG does not return alternate names (contrary to gisgraphy documentation)

Developer README
================
= Dependencies =
OpenPlaceSearch depends on a number of libraries :
* Joda-Time
* Guava-IO (until Scala-IO is merged to the official scala: https://github.com/scala-incubator/scala-io)
* HC-Helpers
* IBM icu4j


= How to update the reference data =
* git status # make sure the tree is clean (in case things don't go smooth)
* $ referencedata/update
* sbt test
* git status # sanity check
* git commit -m "updated the reference data"


= Import as an eclipse project =

* setup SbtEclipsify : http://blog.xebia.fr/2010/05/11/configurer-vos-projets-sbt-pour-eclipse-ou-intellij-idea/
* sbt eclipse
* import as an existing eclipse project
